This is Phantasmal's objectd written by Noah Gibbs, the HTTPD has no
dependencies on it; but it's a nice thing to have. Note that I have made
minor changes to it to get it to work outside of the Phantasmal library.
Put in mind that little of this actually needs to be in this directory,
in fact, only the two objects in sys/ is necessary -- the other are just
dependencies which I put here for convenience (I don't use any of Noah's
objects elsewhere).

Again, credits should go to Noah Gibbs for everything in this directory!
