Structure of the repository:

You probably want to check out the documentation in trunk/usr/Jorinde/doc/
and all doc/ directories below there.

If you check out the entire source tree, you will want to move things around 
a bit. Under the Kernel Library for DGD you will probably want to move 
things along these lines:

Path in source tree                  Path within the DGD environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------
/dgd-httpd/trunk/usr          to     /usr 
/dgd-httpd/www/lsp            to     /usr/www/webroot/lsp
/dgd-httpd/vendor/objectd     to     /usr/System/objectd
