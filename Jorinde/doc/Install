This file is largely a TODO, but for now this is a start...

Checklist to set up a fresh install of DGD and the HTTPD:

[x] Download the Jorinde Package.

[ ]	Download DGD from ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/experimental/ then pick
    the platform of your choice (the newer version the better), either you
	download a binary or you compile your own.

[ ]	Install DGD.

[ ]	Move the directories in the Jorinde package into /dgd/mud/usr/ so that
	you get /usr/Jorinde/, /usr/System/ and /usr/www

[ ]	Set up DGD to listen to two ports (default configuration of the httpd
	wants port 80 and 81), edit /dgd/mud.dgd and change the binary_port
	in the config to this:
		binary_port = ([ "*":6048, "*":80 ])
	...on older version of DGD you want to do this instead of the above:
		binary_port = ({ 6048, 80 });

[ ]	Start up DGD using the 'mud.dgd' file as in argument (or if you use
	windows, select open from menu)
