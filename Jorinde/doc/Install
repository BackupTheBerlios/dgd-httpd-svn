/**
 * To install on top of the DGD kernel:
 *
 * - Extract this package to [MUDLIB-ROOT]/usr/System/ (directory httpd should
 *   be created).
 *
 * - Add a new binary port to your DGD configuration. By default Jorinde will
 *   use index 1 of the array. This would start HTTPD on port 80:
 *   |  binary_port = ({ 6048, 80 });
 *   ...or as of DGD 1.2.70 (or around there):
 *   |  ([ "*":6048, "*":80 ])
 *
 * - Create directory: [MUDLIB-ROOT]/usr/System/www/root
 *
 * - Make a copy of obj/app.c and modify it to your likings, for now you will
 *   also need to modify sys/server.c to use your modified app.c -- this
 *   WILL change.
 *
 * - Add the following line to /usr/System/initd's create() function:
 *   if(!find_object("httpd/initd")) compile_object("httpd/initd");
 *   Note that it depends on some kernel-files to be compiled before
 *   it will work (accessd comes to mind, for instance).
 *
 * - Restart DGD.
 *
 * - Pray.
 *
 * - Point a web-browser to http://your-hostname/
